description: The characteristic structure of a sterane molecule, a biomarker. Living
  organisms possess exclusively one type of sterols, but during diagenesis and catagenesis,
  steranes are gradually transformed, until an equilibrium is reached. Thus, the ratio
  of transformed steranes to untransformed steranes can be used to estimate the maturity
  of sedimentary rock and the thermal history of a sedimentary basin. (Image by Prof.
