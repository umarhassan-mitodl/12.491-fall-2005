Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: Two sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Overview
--------

In this course, we will evaluate and discuss the formation and diagnostic structural properties of organic matter with particular emphasis on chemical fossils. The topics to be covered include:

*   Biological and Non-biological Formation of Organic Matter
*   The Classification and Chemical Structures of Biomarkers
*   Biomarker Relationships to Organism Physiology and Phylogeny
*   Preservation Potential and Mechanisms; Diagenesis, Kerogen Formation and Hydrocarbon Generation
*   Analytical Techniques used to Study Biomarkers and Kerogen
*   Paleoreconstruction using Biomarkers

Format
------

Each week's effort will comprise a Friday overview lecture (1-1.5 hrs) and assigned readings. The Wednesday session will be a group seminar of the topic of the previous week. In these discussions, participants will present a synopsis and critique of one of the readings.

Grading
-------

Two term papers will be required for 50% of the credit (pass/fail unless otherwise agreed). The remaining 50% will be awarded on the basis of contribution to the weekly seminar.
